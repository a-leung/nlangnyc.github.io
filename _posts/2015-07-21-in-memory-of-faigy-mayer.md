title: In memory of Faigy Mayer
---

I only met Faigy recently when she started coming to N-languages' morning Code Gym. She was so gung ho about iOS and wanted a job in it. We started talking over the same Apple Watches we had. She had the same Apple Watch as mine, same model and band, but smaller. It was very cool to meet someone that had the same interest in Watch as me. (FINALLY!)

Faigy was going bonkers for an iOS development position. I remembered we had an opening for an iOS person and in fact, a junior position. I asked Faigy for her resume and some code (our company is a code driven culture.) She said she would work on it and show me some in a week. I saw her the next week and told her that well, the person she would be working for is very tough on code (from my experience.) We agreed working at our company would not be a good fit for her first job.

I asked around some of my more senior iOS if they had any openings for a junior iOS developer (it couldn't help, right?) None did.

Faigy came around to a few more code gyms and we greeted each other. She was still looking for an iOS job and it looked like she was making some headway.

It was such a shock for me when I saw Faigy's picture on Gothamist this morning. I just came back to the office from the morning code gym and didn't see her. It was ok, she didn't RSVP. I know she's been busy with things and didn't think more of her absence. After reading the Gothamist article more, it was clear why Faigy did not come to code gym.

I'm so sad that Faigy won't be part of this world anymore and that her time here was so short. I knew her for such a short time and so little of her. Yet, her absence is producing such a huge impact in me and others around her.

Faigy, may peace be with you.
