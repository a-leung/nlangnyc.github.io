    <p>I only met Faigy recently when she started coming to N-languages’ morning Code Gym. She was so gung ho about iOS and wanted a job in it. We started talking over the same Apple Watches we had. She had the same Apple Watch as mine, same model and band, but smaller. It was very cool to meet someone that had the same interest in Watch as me. (FINALLY!)</p>

<p>I’m so sad that Faigy won’t be part of this world anymore and that her time here was so short. I knew her for such a short time and so little of her. Yet, her absence is producing such a huge impact in me and others around her.</p>

<p>Faigy, may peace be with you.</p>
